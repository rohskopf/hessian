This is the git repo for the Hessian potential. Steps to install are:

1) Put all files in the LAMMPS (version 17Nov16) src directory
2) Compile LAMMPS

Steps to use this potential are:
1) Obtain the force constant Hessian matrix for your system
2) Use pair_style neighlist_gen to generate a NEIGHLIST file
3) Use write_fclist.m to map force constants onto that neighbor list
4) Use pair_style hessian2 to run the potential
